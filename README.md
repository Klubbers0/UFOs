## Results

This webpage can be used to search for ufo sightings by using and manipulating five different search critera, Date, City, State, Country, and shape of the sighting. These results also display duration of the sighting as well as any comments about the sighting. One might use this webpage and subsequent data to support a theory for or against UFO's being real

Below is an image of the search criteria that can be used on the webpage.
