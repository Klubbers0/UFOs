## Results

This webpage can be used to search for UFO sightings by using and manipulating five different search critera, Date, City, State, Country, and shape of the sighting. These results also display duration of the sighting as well as any comments about the sighting. To use the search function, enter in your critera to search by, in the search boxes. As you enter in your search criteria the information to the right will narrow down based on your search criteria. 

Below is an image of the search criteria that can be used on the webpage.

## Summary
Overall, this webpage has a clean look that is easy to use, while still providing a great deal of data. It would be helpful to look up simple information based on UFO sightings. The drawbacks to this type of page is there no supporting documentataion, where one might cite a source, or look further into each sighting. In the future, creating hyperlinks that provide further information, or information for citing, would be benefical to this page.
